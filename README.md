# Running a React App with TypeScript
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running an existing React application with TypeScript.

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the Git repository containing your React app. You can use Git's clone command to do this. Replace [git@github.com:winniegithubrit/winnie-assessment.git] with the actual URL of your Git repository.


git clone [git@github.com:winniegithubrit/winnie-assessment.git]




# cd your-react-app
cd into the winnie-assesment directory

# Step 3: Install Dependencies
To install the required project dependencies, run the following command:


npm install
This command will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries used in your React app.

# Step 4: Start the Development Server
run the React app locally, use the following command:


npm start
This will start the development server, and your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

# Step 5: Open Your App in a Web Browser
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your React app with TypeScript in action.
